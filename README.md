# "Second record was called Morningrise"~ Mikael Ã…kerfeldt 

Hello there, chaps. My name is Omar :3 people usually call me "Vent" (online, that is). 

## A few facts about me

Most of my personal interests revolve around computers and it's internals, the web isn't that interesting for me. Sysadmin stuff rocks!

I also like cryptocurrencies a lot :smile: however I don't like <img width="24px" src="https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/2/29/BC_Logo_.png"> Bitcoin  I like <img width="24px" src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/monero-441944.png"> Monero instead. Privacy on money is law :heart:

Music? I'm in love with progressive rock / metal :metal: you'll probablly encounter a few Opeth references while exploring my repositories.

| It's not even debatable |  What C++ should look like  |  JS is overrated, stick with classics  |  Orchid didn't make itself  |  The old working Golang  |  The new working Pascal  |



## Unpopular Opinions :persevere:

* Technology isn't politics, focus on science and innovation those are more important :heart:
* Codes Of Conduct kill projects sometimes by banning good contributors for reasons arbitrary to their coding skills.
* One rude **but** good contributor is worth more than a hunded kind ones.
* JS is not the future, it is only more popular.
* The only obsolete and useless programming languages are the ones you cannot master with your current skill.
