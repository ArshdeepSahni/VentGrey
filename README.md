# "Second record was called Morningrise"~ Mikael Ã…kerfeldt 

Hello there, chaps. My name is Omar :3 people usually call me "Vent" (online, that is). 

## A few facts about me

I'm a Mexican software developer, sysadmin and DevOps specialist (most of the time), a highly-proud free-software (as in freedom) activist and a happy contributor to free software repositories so, if I follow you on GitHub I will probably look all your repos for the sake of curiosity. 

Most of my personal interests revolve around computers and it's internals, the world-wide popular web development isn't that interesting for me, especially because nowadays people just compete on who over-engineers more their apps. So for me Sysadmin stuff rocks! and so programming languages like C, Rust, Pascal, etc. I'm not saying the web sucks...much *BUT* we do need sysadmins too so I'll be happy to assist you if you happen to need help :wink:

I also like cryptocurrencies a lot :smile: however I don't like <img width="24px" src="https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/2/29/BC_Logo_.png"> Bitcoin  I like <img width="24px" src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/monero-441944.png"> Monero instead. Privacy on money is law :heart:


## Other things I love :heart:

* :notes: I love progressive Rock / Metal. Specially Steven Wilson and Opeth :metal:
* :smiley_cat: Cats are the *cutest* animal on earth.
* :penguin: Y'all know what this means.
* :musical_keyboard: Piano :D
* :star2: viewing repos of my comrades.
* :grey_question: Not knowing things.
* Don't FAANG :heart:


## My GitHub status. This thing is to showoff...isn't it? :thinking:

| The nicest language on earth |  C++ who is afraid of stdin  |  JavaScript with an :elephant:  |  `sh` with strange things called *"bashisms"*  |  Golang with a Cheetah and `^` pointers  |  Pascal with a blue beaver who is afraid of unused imports  |

### Programming Languages I'd LOVE to learn:
* Julia (The purple matlab thingy)
* Vala (Kotlin for GNOME)
* C++ (C that takes years to compile)
* ASM/LLVM (Suffering made easy)
* Kotlin :calling: (Java created by people who makes expensive IDE's)


### Other Programming Languages I've used but I'm not really interested mastering:

* Python :snake: (Pseudocode that works)
* Perl :camel: (Write scripts that *only you* can understand)
* Java :coffee: (Object is an object whose parent is object at the object class)
* Scala :coffee:++ (Java that works)
* C# (Java made by windows guys)
* Lisp ((((((lisp))))))
* JavaScript (I was about to make a joke here but there is already a framework for that)
* Typescript (I was about to make a joke here but there is already a framework for that: Any)
* Dart (*ANOTHER* google language?)
* Ruby (:scream: OMG A RED PYTHON)
* R (R => R)



## Unpopular Opinions :persevere:

* Technology **IS NOT** politics, focus on science and innovation those are more important than "which term is more or less inclusive", "is this issue too toxic?" and other things. Science needs you to solve problems with your head :heart:
* Codes Of Conduct are absolutely ridiculous and sometimes kill projects sometimes by banning good contributors for reasons arbitrary to their coding skills.
* One rude **BUT** good contributor is worth more than a hunded kind and flawed ones.
* JavaScript is not the future, it is only more popular.
* The only obsolete and useless programming languages are the ones you cannot master with your current skill.
* C and C++ aren't insecure and **super-dangerous**, devs don't read new standards and they suck at C/C++.
* Even if Rust is king :crab: it's highly-verbose syntax is higly carcinogenic :sweat_smile:
* Newer languages aren't **THAT** awesome as they claim to be. 
* Serverless, Containers and other *"popular terms"* have been around for too long. Someone just found how to make them popular using ridiculous names.
* PHP isn't *"obsolete"* or *"dead"*. It also doesn't have horrible code. Horrible code comes from horrible programmers.
* `-O3` doesn't produce faulty code, if it does, your code is wrong, not the compiler.
* O'Caml is scary :ghost: :camel:
* YAML sucks :neutral_face:
* "Cross platform" usually means "Web interface" which isn't really better
* Using a lot of dependencies doesn't make a project "smart" it makes it "bloated"
* Some garbage **IS NOT OK**
* The popular mindset of "the client doesn't care how you did it, it cares that the project just works" is precisely the one who is making us drown in bugs.
* Frameworks are becoming developer friendly but machine agressive.
* "We have too much memory nowadays", "We have massive storage" are just excuses for people who can't build efficient software.
* Static binaries are bloated
